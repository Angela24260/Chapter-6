# Chapter-6: Using Common Widgets
What I Learned:
In this chapter, I explored some of the most commonly used Flutter widgets that are essential for building dynamic and interactive UIs. I learned how to utilize widgets like Text, Image, ListView, and GridView, which form the building blocks for many mobile apps. The Text widget was essential for displaying text content, while the Image widget allowed me to display static and network images.

I also delved into two important scrollable widgets: ListView and GridView. These widgets are used for displaying lists of items in a vertically or grid-based layout, respectively, and are highly customizable. I learned how to dynamically generate list items using ListView.builder() and how to optimize performance when dealing with large datasets. With GridView, I explored how to create flexible, multi-column layouts for displaying content in a grid, offering a more structured and aesthetically pleasing way to present data.

### Achievement:
My hands-on achievement for this chapter was building a contact list app using ListView and GridView. The app displayed a list of contacts with images, names, and phone numbers. I utilized ListView.builder() to efficiently handle the list, and GridView for a secondary view that displayed contacts in a grid format. The project helped me understand how to work with dynamic content and enhanced my ability to create responsive UIs that can adapt to different data sets.
